On embedded systems, the [Device Tree](https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_What_It_Is) helps the kernel understand various peripherals that are connected to the board and how to initialize them. These hardware might be things like LDO regulators, various controllers, GPIO, etc which are generic, but yet needs certain configuration that should not be hard-coded into the kernel. To understand more about device trees I recommend you start with the Raspberry Pi [documentation on this topic](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md). There are more links at the end of this article.



Overlays:
------------

Step 1: Clone this repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mnltake/seeed-linux-dtoverlays
cd seeed-linux-dtoverlays

```
Step 2: Install *.dtbo:
```sh
make all_rpi
sudo make install_rpi
sudo reboot
```
more:
```sh
@echo "Targets:"
@echo "  all_<PLATFORM>:            Build all device tree binaries for <PLATFORM>"
@echo "  clean_<PLATFORM>:          Clean all generated files for <PLATFORM>"
@echo "  install_<PLATFORM>:        Install all generated files for <PLATFORM> (sudo)"
@echo ""
@echo "  overlays/<PLATFORM>/<DTS>.dtbo   Build a single device tree binary"
@echo ""
@echo "PLATFORMES: jetsonnano bb stm32mp1 rpi imx6ull"

```

## Modules:
------------
Mainline does not have a kernel module, or there is controversy about a kernel module that does work well. We will also collect them together and put them here.
The kernel modules will have the corresponding documentation and detailed instructionsã€‚
